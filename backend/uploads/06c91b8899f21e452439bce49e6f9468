Hello and welcome to the course Business Intelligence and Analytics.This is a course as the title suggests related to generating intelligence for business.And it appears from the title that business can be done with intelligence and analyticsand business can be done without intelligence and without analytics as well.Obviously from the title of the course it appears that business would benefit from intelligenceand analytics.There are two constituents or two components there.So this being the first class, we will try to develop some essential and fundamentalunderstanding about what is intelligence and what is analytics.So what is intelligence is a very loaded question because it requires us to understand the philosophybehind intelligence.Many of you must have heard about a measure called intelligence quotient or IQ.And I am sure some of us have taken our IQ test and got some scores.
